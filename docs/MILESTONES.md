## Critical path

The dependency chain that determines minimum project timeline:

```
M1 ──► M2 ──────────────────► M3 ──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                       │                                                 │
        │                       └──► M6 ──► M7 ──► M8 ──► M12 ──┐              │
        │                                    │                     │              │
        └──► M4 ──► M5 ──► M6 (above)        └──► M9 ──► M10 ──► M13 ──► M14 ──┘
                                              │          M11 ──┘
                                              └──► M9 (above)
```

**Linear critical path (minimum sequencing):**

```
M1 → M2 → M3 → M6 → M7 → M8 → M9 → M10 → M13 → M14
```

**What can run in parallel:**

| Parallel track A | Parallel track B |
|---|---|
| M2 (IdentityRegistry) | M4 (Database) — already done |
| M3 (LoanFactory + LoanContract) | M5 (Laravel Auth) after M4 |
| M6 (KYC API) after M2+M5 | M9 (Frontend Auth) after M5 |
| M7 (Loan API) after M3+M6 | M11 (Lender/Officer UI) after M9+M7 |
| M8 (Event Listener) after M7 | M12 (Audit Portal) after M9+M8 |
| M10 (Borrower UI) after M9+M7 | |

**Estimated total timeline:**
- Sequential (one person, one task at a time): ~65–80 days
- Parallel (two tracks): ~40–50 days
- With AI agents accelerating each milestone: ~15–25 days

**Two milestones complete. Next to start: M2 (IdentityRegistry) and M5
(Laravel Auth) — these can begin in parallel immediately.**

---

## Multi-agent parallelism notes

M4 (database) can run in parallel with M2/M3 (smart contracts) — this
is why we did Phase 5 before formalizing this roadmap. M9 (frontend auth)
can also start as soon as M5 is done, in parallel with M6/M7/M8.

**If working with two AI agent sessions simultaneously**, the safe parallel
pairs are:
- Agent A: M2 → M3 (smart contracts)
- Agent B: M5 → M6 (backend, once M4 done)

Never run two agents on M3 and M7 simultaneously — M7 depends on M3's
contract addresses being finalized.
